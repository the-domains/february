Before the Christmas break we took the whole team to the South Bank for a trip to the Design Museum. There were a couple of exhibitions on -- [Cycle Revolution][0]and the Designs of the Year 2015\. For the keen cyclists in our team the bike exhibition, complete with Sir Chris Hoy's 2012 Olympic track bike and Sir Bradley Wiggins' World Championship Time Trial bike, was almost too much to take. It's basically top shelf cycle porn!

The Designs of the Year had everything from awe-inspiring architecture, to a solution to plastic pollution in the oceans. Microsoft Lumia handsets added a level of interaction by allowing the user to 'tap and explore' certain portions of the exhibition further. If you can get down there it's well worth a look.

A few pictures of our visit can be found on our Instagram account[here][1], including our early morning trip to the Regency Cafe and an attack by crazed seagulls over Westminster Bridge!
